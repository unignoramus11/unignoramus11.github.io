# Personal Webiste

## Introduction

This is my personal website created by me as a part of my Introduction to Software Systems course.

## Important Points / Assumptions

1. I have designed separate UIs for mobile devices and desktop devices. These have significantly different layouts. For example, while the desktop view displays the navigation pane as a navbar on top, the mobile view renders it as a hamburger menu.

2. The blogs currently store the likes and comments in the local storage of the client's computer, and so it is not synced across devices.

3. The

   > "hyperlink that points to a file (e.g. your resume) in your local file system"

   task has been implemented by me in the form of a PDF document in the NZEB blog (second blog) which has more details regarding the blog content itself.

4. All the icons are obtained from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
